# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed. This project requires Node.js version 20.10.0.

You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To start the project, make sure you have Vite installed globally:

## install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn

```

# Development

## To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

# Build

## To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate a dist folder with the optimized production build.

# Linting

## To lint your code using ESLint, use the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

This will check for linting errors and provide suggestions for improvement.

# Preview

## To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```

This will serve the production build locally for previewing before deployment.
